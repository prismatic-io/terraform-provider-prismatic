# prismatic_organization_user (Resource)

Manage Organization Users in Prismatic.

This resource allows you to create, update, and delete organization users in Prismatic. Organization users are users that belong to your organization (as opposed to customer users).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get organization roles to assign to users
data "prismatic_organization_roles" "roles" {}

# Find the Admin role
locals {
  admin_role = [for r in data.prismatic_organization_roles.roles.roles : r if r.name == "Admin"][0]
}

# Create an organization user with Admin role
resource "prismatic_organization_user" "admin" {
  email = "admin@example.com"
  name  = "Admin User"
  role  = local.admin_role.id
}
```

## Import

Organization users can be imported using the user ID:

```shell
terraform import prismatic_organization_user.admin <user_id>
```
